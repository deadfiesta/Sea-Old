Whenever you doubt what type of motion to use in your animation, use standard curve."},{title:"Symmetry / Asymmetry Curve",anchor:"curve",description:"According to Material Design Guidelines, it is better to use an asymmetric curve to make the movement look more natural and realistic. The end of the curve must be more emphasized than its beginning, so that the duration of acceleration is shorter than that of slowing down. In this case, the user will pay more attention to the final movement of the element and thus to its new state."},{title:"Ease-in / Acceleration",anchor:"acceleration",description:"Ease-in or acceleration curve is the movement that starts slowly and accelerates over time. Ease-in-out is used when the objects move from one part of the screen to another. In such case, animation avoids the eye-catching and dramatic effect."},{title:"Ease-out / Deceleration",anchor:"deceleration",description:"Easing out causes the animation to start more quickly than linear ones, and it also has deceleration at the end. This type of curve should be used when the element emerges on the screen \u2014 it flies up on the screen at full speed, gradually slows down until it completely stops.
